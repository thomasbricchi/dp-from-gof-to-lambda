----------------------- | --------------
Command                 | Functions

Template                | Consumer
Observer                | Consumer
Decorator               | Functions composition
Chain of Responsibility | Stream of functions
Interpreter             | Map of functions
Visitor                 | Pattern matching + Functions


The video of talk where I implemented this patterns in a live coding session is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZG74WbnhoE).

Same patterns have also been reimplemented in [Swift](https://github.com/truizlop/GOFToLambda) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/lmller/gof-in-kotlin).
